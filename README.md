# 🌍 Life Expectancy vs. GDP Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between **life expectancy** and **GDP** across various countries, regions, and years. Using real-world data from `all_data.csv`, I processed and visualized trends using Python in a Jupyter Notebook (`life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb`). This project was completed as part of Codecademy's **Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist** career path.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- **Data Exploration**: Practice loading, cleaning, and examining real-world datasets using Python and Pandas.
- **Data Aggregation**: Learn how to compute summary statistics like average GDP and life expectancy by year.
- **Data Visualization**: Build meaningful scatter plots using Matplotlib to show relationships in the data.
- **Data Analysis**: Draw insights by interpreting trends between economic indicators and public health.

## 🔧 What I Did

- **Loaded the Dataset**: Imported a global dataset containing GDP and life expectancy figures.
- **Processed the Data**: Cleaned the data and computed averages grouped by year and country.
- **Visualized Trends**: Created scatter plots to visualize the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
- **Extracted Insights**: Analyzed patterns to better understand how a country's wealth might impact longevity.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Pandas for Data Analysis**: Gained hands-on experience with data grouping, aggregation, and transformation.
- **Matplotlib for Visualization**: Learned to create effective visualizations that tell a story with the data.
- **Critical Thinking**: Practiced interpreting data-driven relationships between socioeconomic and health indicators.
- **Project Structure**: Strengthened skills in organizing Jupyter Notebooks to communicate findings clearly.

📄 I wrote a summary of this project in my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@ahmadgrahamdev/does-a-countrys-wealth-impact-how-long-people-live-ff3adbb429a2):  
**"Does a Country's Wealth Impact How Long People Live?"**

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with the Jupyter extension.
3. Make sure the dataset `all_data.csv` is in the same directory.
4. Run the notebook cells from top to bottom to explore the data and see the visualizations.
