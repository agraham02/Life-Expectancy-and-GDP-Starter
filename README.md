# Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between life expectancy and GDP across different regions and years. The primary data source is a CSV file (`all_data.csv`), which is processed and visualized in a Jupyter Notebook (`life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb`). This was completed as part of Codecademy's Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist course.

## Learning Goals and Objectives

-   **Data Exploration:** Gain experience in loading, cleaning, and exploring real-world datasets.
-   **Data Aggregation:** Learn how to compute aggregated metrics such as average life expectancy and GDP by year.
-   **Data Visualization:** Develop skills in creating scatter plots to visualize relationships using matplotlib.
-   **Analytical Skills:** Understand how to interpret and analyze data trends to draw meaningful conclusions.

## What I Did

-   **Data Loading:** Imported the CSV dataset containing global data on life expectancy and GDP.
-   **Data Processing:** Calculated average values for life expectancy and GDP by year.
-   **Visualization:** Created a scatter plot to display the relationship between life expectancy and GDP.
-   **Insights:** Analyzed the scatter plot to observe trends and potential correlations between economic and health indicators.

## What I Learned

-   **Pandas for Data Processing:** Improved skills in data manipulation, including grouping and averaging data.
-   **Matplotlib for Visualization:** Enhanced my ability to create clear, informative plots that effectively communicate data trends.
-   **Analytical Reasoning:** Gained a deeper understanding of how socioeconomic factors like GDP can correlate with public health indicators such as life expectancy.
-   **Project Workflow:** Understood the importance of documenting and organizing code, analyses, and findings in a cohesive manner.

## How to Run the Project

1. Open the `life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb` notebook in Visual Studio Code or a Jupyter Notebook interface.
2. Ensure that `all_data.csv` is in the correct directory.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, process it, and generate the visualizations.

Happy analyzing!
